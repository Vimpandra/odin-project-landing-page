                    <p><strong>Frida</strong> used to be extremely antisocial, but with age she has become a loving little lady. She loves climbing to high places and blanket tents. She is the queen in the house. Her will, my hands.</p>

                    <div class="image-card maizena"></div>
                    <p><strong>Maizena</strong> is the middle child. He's always been playful, loves to cuddle and to be around people. He has no teeth. But most importantly of all: he likes to meow. All. The. Time. </p>

                    <div class="image-card tomilho"></div>
                    <p><strong>Tomilho</strong> is the youngest. He was found under the hood of a car, all covered in dirt. He has always kept this aptitude to squeeze into tight dark places and stay there for hours. </p>

            <p>Cats are dangerous wild apex predators that you can take on your arms, cuddle and give little kisses. This is true to all kinds of cats, big and small.</p>
